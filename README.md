# ‚òÄÔ∏è PV_APP ‚Äì Photovoltaic Energy Production Prediction

## Project Status: In Development üöß

An application for analyzing and predicting electricity production from photovoltaic (PV) systems based on weather data and historical production data.

---

## üß† Features

- Load and clean weather and PV production data from CSV files
- Train a machine learning model (Random Forest) to predict energy production
- Generate predictions for future days


---

## üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn

## üöß Future development

- Improved Forecasting: The application will evolve to predict not only energy production but also solar panel performance over time. This will include the efficiency of the PV system, taking into account various factors like holidays and weather conditions.

- Decision-Making for Energy Selling: A new feature will be added to help users decide when to sell electricity back to the grid and when to store it. By predicting energy production patterns, users can optimize energy sales based on market prices and weather forecasts.

- API Integration: The application will be extended to provide an API for easier integration with frontend

- Frontend Interface: A user-friendly frontend will be developed to allow easy interaction with the system. The frontend will visualize energy production predictions, panel efficiency trends, and suggest optimal times for selling or storing energy.
